 # Password Generator

This is a simple password generator app built with React. It allows users to generate a random password based on specified criteria such as length, character types (lowercase, uppercase, symbols, numbers), and copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries

```typescriptreact
import React from "react";
import { useState } from "react";
```

We import the React library and the `useState` hook from the React library. The `useState` hook allows us to manage state in functional components.

### 2. Defining the `PasswordIndex` Component

```typescriptreact
export default function PasswordIndex(props: {className: string}) {
  const className = props.className;
```

We define the `PasswordIndex` component, which is the main component of our app. It takes a `className` prop, which is used to apply CSS classes to the component.

### 3. Defining State Variables

```typescriptreact
  const [passwordData, setPasswordData] = useState(String);
  const [passwordLength, setPasswordLength] = useState(Number);
  const [useLowerCase, setUseLowerCase] = useState(Boolean);
  const [useUpperCase, setUseUpperCase] = useState(Boolean);
  const [useSymbols, setUseSymbols] = useState(Boolean);
  const [useNumbers, setUseNumbers] = useState(Boolean);
  const [sucessfulMessage, setSuccessfulMessage] = useState(String);
```

We define several state variables using the `useState` hook:

- `passwordData`: This state variable stores the generated password.
- `passwordLength`: This state variable stores the desired length of the password.
- `useLowerCase`: This state variable determines whether to include lowercase letters in the password.
- `useUpperCase`: This state variable determines whether to include uppercase letters in the password.
- `useSymbols`: This state variable determines whether to include symbols in the password.
- `useNumbers`: This state variable determines whether to include numbers in the password.
- `sucessfulMessage`: This state variable stores a success message when the password is copied to the clipboard.
